In this topic instead of using the iterative approach, we use the recursive approach

-In case of recursion we have to call the function from the same Function itself

-As Compare to the iteration recursion is heavy as every recursion is heavy for every recursion call we need separate stack frame

-We can solve every problem statement which contains the loop by using the recursive approach
