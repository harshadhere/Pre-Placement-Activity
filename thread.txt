//After creating the thread class object we call the start method 
  //that method will internally call run method when the thread sheduler shedules our thread .
  //when the thread gets sheduled and how much time qauntom gets allocated for the thread is not predictable 
  //if our application contains multiple thread then the thread exucution order is purelly depends on the thread sheduler
  //if we want to suspend the execution of a current thread for specific time intervel then we call sleep method
  //if we want to suspend the execution of application till any of the specific thread complete its task then we call join method
  //consider the below lifecycle of thread  
  //thread life cycle 
  //new start runnale running waiting dead

States of THreads

//NEW = when we create the object of thread class using new keyword 
our thread object goes into new state
//Runnable =When we call the start() method using the thread class
object the thread goes into runnable 
//RUnning = when the thread sheduler shedules our thread the thread goes into the running state
(run methods gets called the
//Waiting = in this state sheduled as well as it is running but due to 
some reason the execution of thread gets stoped (sleep method)
//dead = the execution of thread gets stop resourse gets deallocated
