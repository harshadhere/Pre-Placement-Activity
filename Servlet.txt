consider the below application 
 



in the above application, we have to import the desired packages like javax.Servlet;, javax.servlet.http;

to create the servlet application we have to design one class that extends Httpservlet class 

Inside HttpServlet class there is one method named as DOGET() which gets AUtoMAticALLY called when the client sends the request to the server.

this do get method has two parameters as request and response 

The request parameter contains the data requested by the client and the response parameter is empty 


Inside the logic of our application, we have to feel the data inside the response object 

the response obect should contain such data which is understandable by the client that is html

consider the below example of the client-server architecture 

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

SERVLET LIFECYCLE 

Step 1: The client sends the request to a server (Apache) Inside the server our servlet application is running.(Testing Servlet.Java)

         Inside a server, there is a web container(TOM CAT) which is responsible to execute .class file of our java application(TestingServlet.class)

     
 
Step 2: After getting the request from the client the web container creates two objects as request and response. 

	   Currently request object contains the request and the response object is empty 

Step 3: After getting the request from the client the  server will create one thread and call the method named as doget() or service

Step 4: After getting the request the doGet() method will fill the data inside the response object.

	  as the response object is used by the client and the client contains the web browser and the web browser only understand the html,the response object should contain the data in html format

Step 5: After completing the execution the web container receives the response object which contains the data which has to be forwarded to the client 

Step 6: Now the Web container sends the response object to the client using the http protocol

	 After sending the response to the thread and request, the response object gets deleted as our server completes one request

SERVLET PROJECT STRUCTURE


Consider the below structure of the servlet application that we have to create on the server side 


Consider the below diagram which demonstrates the project structure of the servlet.

We have to form the below project structure manually as 


In the above diagram is the name of the project.

The SRC folder contains the source code of our application 

Inside the web-INF folder, we have to create a project dependency file web.xml and the classes folder will contain the .class file of the servlet application

Consider the below file structure of the XML file and its mapping 
xml.mapping.php 

The previous explanation is for the cojncept servlet in servlet we write html syntax inside the java syntax 

There is one old concept in java named as JSP which contains java SYntax inside the html syntax
